# PixelPlatform
Basic pixel platform website design

This is a simple Pixel platformer which has been created
using the paper.js library.

####Name Tag
This is placed inside the html source just so it's easier
for anyone to edit

####Css Pages
Css Pages are there to style everything and without them
You wouldn't have any style

####Javascript
paper.js is an opensource library for animation through
javascript www.paperjs.org

The main javascript is placed inside the source html
code because for some reason when you load the html from
localy, instead of localy hosting it wont be read from a
javascript file. Unless you can host the pages through a
localhost then the javascript can be placed in an external
js document.

Have fun an Enjoy this Pixel Platformer
